The AcuGIS Leaflet Maps Plugin allows you to create and display custom, stylish maps simply and easily.

The AcuGIS works with any map provider (Google, OpenStreetMap, MapBox, BING, MapQuest, etc..) as well as our own maps.

The AcuGIS Leaflet Map plugin is designed for ease of use.  Just click the marker icon and drop it onto the map.  Enter the location or address and address auto-complete will place the marker where you want it.  

In addition to markers, you can also draw lines, polygons and squares. 

A WYSIWYG editor allows you to add formatted text, images, and links to marker pop-ups.  Marker pop-ups can be standard or fancy modal see [screenshots] (https://wordpress.org/plugins/mapfig-premium-leaflet-map-maker/screenshots/).

Add maps to your pages and posts in one click using the "Add AcuGIS Map" button see [screenshot 4] (https://wordpress.org/plugins/mapfig-premium-leaflet-map-maker/screenshots/).

An integrated Widget is also included as well as Social Share, export, and all of the features below.

The AcuGIS Leaflet Map plugin is 100% free with a limit of 5 maps.  

For unlimited maps, it is only $5! The $5 also provides you with direct support and free updates and upgrades.
